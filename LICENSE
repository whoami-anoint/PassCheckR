 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim or modified
 copies of this license document, and changing it is allowed as long
 as the name is changed.

           TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the software
     source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
     you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
     appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty;
     keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to
     the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of
     the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any
     portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and
     copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms
     of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

     a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
        stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

     b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that
        in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or
        any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to
        all third parties under the terms of this License.

     c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
        when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
        interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display
        an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and
        a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
        a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
        these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
        License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
        does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
        the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
     under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the
     terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one
     of the following:

     a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
        source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
        1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

     b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
        years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
        cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
        machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
        distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
        customarily used for software interchange; or,

     c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
        to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is
        allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
        received the program in object code or executable form with
        such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
     except as expressly provided under this License
